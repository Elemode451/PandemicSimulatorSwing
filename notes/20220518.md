# Meeting notes 05/18/2022

## Person class (worked on by F block):
- Age (different probabilities for being different ages)
- Age between 0 and 29200 days
- Preexisting Conditions (different severities, low pct of population has these)
- Randomly select age and preexisting conditions 
- Immunity value (calculated based on age and preexisting conditions)
- Infected
- Recovered (unable to be infected again)
- Dead (unable to be infected again)

## Virus class (worked on by E block, all values settable by user):
- Infectability (pct value)
- Lethality (pct between 0 and 1)
- Which age group is susceptible to dying (segregate people into 3 groups, and have multi select for each age group)
- Incubation period and resistance period (both settable by user, person isn't able to die during incubation period, and every day during resistance period, certain pct. chance to die depending on immunity, if survives entire resistance period, is immune)
- Stretch goal: mutations

## Sim attributes:
- Pct of people who get vaccinated (vaccine available from day one)

## Simulation process:
- At start of simulation, initialize a number (start with 500?) people, and set random person as patient zero
- Every day, the infected people interact with 12 random people a day
- Out of those 12 people, each has a random chance of being infected based on the infectability of the virus
- When a person gets infected, they aren't able to die during the incubation period, but can spread the virus
- During the resistance period, the person has a chance of dying each day based on the immunity value
- If the person survives the entire resistance period, they are considered immune and no longer infectable and cannot infect others
- If the person dies during the resistance period, they are no longer infectable and cannot infect others
- Every day, increment everyone's ages by one day
- Calculate R0 
- Bonus: if person reaches 29200 days of age (80 years), they instantly die
- Step time forward each day, display stats of \# of susceptible, infected and dead/recovered each day (add graphs if possible later)
- Have skip button to step multiple days at once
- Save each day to an ArrayList, and report results from that ArrayList
- Have "End Simulation" button, and at end, show total cases, total deaths, peak day (day with most cases), peak death day (day with most deaths), total length of epidemic in days, how many people died of old age
- Stretch goal: simulate days of week and lower interactions on weekends
